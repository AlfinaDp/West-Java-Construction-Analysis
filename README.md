# West-Java-Construction-Analysis
This project analyzes the number of construction companies across districts and cities in West Java.   The analysis includes **data standardization, outlier detection, categorization into Low/Medium/High, and frequency distribution visualization**.
## Dataset
- [Tugas1-SSD-Alfina Damayanti Putri.xlsx](construction_data.xlsx)  
  Contains:
  - Raw data (number of companies per district/city)  
  - Standardized values (Z-scores)  
  - Outlier detection  
  - Categorization (Low, Medium, High)  
  - Frequency distribution  
## Steps
1. **Data Collection** → Number of construction companies in West Java districts/cities.  
2. **Standardization (Z-score)** → To compare values across different regions.  
3. **Outlier Detection** → To identify extreme values that deviate significantly from the average.  
4. **Categorization** → Classifying regions into:  
   - **Low** (very few companies)  
   - **Medium** (average number of companies)  
   - **High** (a large number of companies)  
5. **Visualization** → Frequency distribution of company categories.  
## Results
- Most regions fall into the **medium** category, indicating company numbers around the average.  
- A few regions, such as **Bandung Barat** and **Pangandaran**, are classified as **low**, with relatively small numbers of companies.  
- Some regions stand out in the **high** category, such as **Bogor, Garut, and Bandung**, with considerably higher company numbers compared to the average.  
## Insights
This classification provides an overview of the distribution of construction companies in West Java:  
- **High-category regions** tend to be economic growth centers.  
- **Low-category regions** may require more investment support or government attention to stimulate infrastructure development.
